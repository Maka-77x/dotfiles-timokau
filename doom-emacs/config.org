* Emacs Config

My literate emacs configuration. Run ~doom sync~ after modifying.

** Org configuration

*** Locations

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-directory "~/data/documents/logseq/")
#+END_SRC

** Org-roam (v1) configuration

Note that we use org-roam v1 for now.

*** Locations

Configure org-roam to use the folder structure that was initialized by logseq. Note that logseq and org-roam are not perfectly compatible, so take care when mixing both tools.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-roam-directory "~/data/documents/logseq/")
(setq org-roam-dailies-directory "journals/")
; Exclude logseq artifacts
(setq org-roam-file-exclude-regexp (concat (regexp-quote "logseq/bak") "\\|" (regexp-quote "logseq/.recycle")))
#+END_SRC
